#### A Machine Learning Pipeline for Understanding Trader Quality and Engagement Behavior Using Dune Analytics Data

Problem Statement

In decentralized trading ecosystems, founders, projects, and platforms often struggle to distinguish between profitable (good) and unprofitable (bad) traders.
Understanding trader quality is crucial for:

* Designing better incentive systems

* Driving sustainable trading activity

* Improving user retention and growth

* Supporting on-chain project strategy and analytics

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a trader is likely to be “good” (profitable, consistent, active) based on their on-chain activity features.
